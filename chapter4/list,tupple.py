# list is mutable 
# tuple is immutable
# string is immutable

# we make list like this

a = [1, 45, "payal", "kalpana", "prajwal"]
print(type(a))

# we make tuple as shown below

b = (12,45, "hello", "payal", 43)
print(type(b))

# to make a tuple with single value 
c=(2,)  #this is single value tuple
