# use comparator oprator to find out wether the given variable is grater than b or not.
a = int(input("enter number1: "))
b = int(input("enter number2: "))
if a>b: print("number1 is greater than number2!")
else: print("number2 is greater than number1!")


# here u can use boolean oprators as shown below

a = int(input("enter numbera: "))
b = int(input("enter numberb: "))

print("is a greater than b? ", a>b)
